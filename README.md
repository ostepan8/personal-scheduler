# Personal Scheduler

All event timestamps are stored internally as absolute instants (UTC epoch).
When interacting with the CLI and HTTP API you provide and view times in your
local time zone. The scheduler converts local inputs to UTC for storage and
converts UTC back to local for display. Google Calendar/Tasks integration also
uses UTC (RFC3339 `Z`) to avoid ambiguity.

Summary:
- **Input and output:** local time
- **Internal storage:** UTC

## Quick Start

1) Configure environment:

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) with at least:

```
API_KEY=changeme
# Optional: require admin for destructive deletes
ADMIN_API_KEY=
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
# Browser origin to allow (for frontends)
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
# Rate limiting (requests per window)
RATE_LIMIT=100
RATE_WINDOW=60
```

2) Build and run the API server:

```
make api && ./api_server
```

3) Call the API (replace the key):

```
curl -H 'Authorization: changeme' http://localhost:8080/events
```

## Running Tests

Use `make test` or run the `./run_all_tests.sh` script to build and execute all unit tests.

## Database Persistence

Events are stored in an SQLite database (`events.db`). On startup the model
loads all events from this database, reconstructing recurring patterns so
commands like `list` and `nextn` work across restarts. The database tests in
`tests/database` verify this behavior.

Schema evolves automatically. If you upgrade from older versions, the server
will add missing columns (`category`, `notifier`, `action`) on startup.

### Preload Horizon

`Model` can optionally limit how far ahead to preload events from the database.
Pass a number of days as the second constructor argument. A negative value (the
default) loads every stored event:

```cpp
// Only load events occurring in the next 30 days
SQLiteScheduleDatabase db("events.db");
Model m(&db, 30);
```

## Event Loop

The scheduler now includes an active `EventLoop` component. Tasks derived from
`Event` (for example `ScheduledTask`) can register notification and execution
callbacks. The loop runs in a background thread, dispatching notifications a
few minutes before each task executes and invoking the task's action at the
scheduled time.

On server startup, all persisted future tasks (events with category `task`)
are re-enqueued so their notifications/actions continue after restarts. If a
task was created via the API/CLI with named notifier/action, those names are
restored and looked up in the registries.

## Customising Notifications and Actions

`ScheduledTask` allows full control over when notifications occur and what
happens when a task runs. You can supply your own callback functions â€“ perfect
for triggering web requests, talking to a Raspberry Pi or scraping a website.

```cpp
// Notify 5 minutes before and call a custom action
ScheduledTask task(
    "abc", "demo", "Demo Task", when,
    std::chrono::hours(1), std::chrono::minutes(5),
    []{ std::cout << "ring ring"; },
    []{ runMyScript(); });
```

Alternatively an absolute notification time can be provided. `Controller`
exposes `scheduleTask` so CLI or agent code can enqueue tasks with different
callbacks or lead times.

## Action Registry

The CLI includes a simple factory for binding named actions to scheduled
events. Actions are registered via `ActionRegistry::registerAction` and can be
referenced when creating tasks with the `addtask` command. `BuiltinActions`
provides a collection of static helpers and a `registerAll()` method that
registers default actions like `hello` and `fetch_example`.

## Notification Registry

Notifications work the same way. `NotificationRegistry::registerNotifier` binds
a name to a callback taking the event ID and title. `BuiltinNotifiers` registers
a simple `console` notifier that prints to stdout. When adding tasks via the CLI
you can choose both a notifier and an action.

## Calendar Integrations

External calendars can be kept in sync by attaching `CalendarApi` implementations to the model. The provided `GoogleCalendarApi` launches a small Python helper that talks to Google Calendar using a service account. Register the API after constructing your model:

```cpp
auto gcal = std::make_shared<GoogleCalendarApi>("service_account.json");
model.addCalendarApi(gcal);
```

Whenever events are added or removed, the Google calendar is updated automatically. Additional providers can subclass `CalendarApi` and call their own scripts.
The helper script is invoked with environment variables passed directly on the command line using the `env` tool. This avoids modifying the process environment so concurrent calendar updates cannot leak credentials between threads.

## API Security

The HTTP server can be secured via environment variables loaded from a `.env` file.
Set `API_KEY` to a secret string and provide it in the `Authorization` header for
all requests. If `ADMIN_API_KEY` is set, destructive DELETE routes (clear all,
delete day/week/before, hard delete) require the admin key; soft deletes are
allowed with the normal API key. Bind address and port are configured with
`HOST` and `PORT`. Rate limiting (`RATE_LIMIT`, `RATE_WINDOW`) and CORS are
configurable (set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your frontend origin). See `.env.example`.

## Events Listing and Expansion

`GET /events` returns stored event seeds by default. To list actual scheduled
occurrences (including expansions of recurring events), use:

```
GET /events?expanded=true&start=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM&end=YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

If `start`/`end` are omitted, it defaults to [now, now + 1 year].
